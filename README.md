This curriculum module explains how the power method (otherwise known as power iteration) works with the help of an interactive MATLAB&reg; live script. The algorithm is analyzed step-by-step with output display and proper visualization. The pros and cons are investigated in terms of speed and accuracy and the module ends with an assignment for further student experimentation. The script can be used by professors teaching linear algebra or students that want to explore and understand how the algorithm works.
